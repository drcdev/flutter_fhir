String id;

//  The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by
// the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be
// associated with version changes to the resource.
Meta meta;

//  A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
// constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.
// Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the
// special rules along with other profiles etc.

String language;

//  Extensions for language
Element element_language;

//  A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and
// can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The
// narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to
// contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to
// just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content
// should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
Narrative text;

//  These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the
// resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently,
// and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.

//  May be used to represent additional information that is not part of
// the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions
// safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to
// the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define
// an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part
// of the definition of the extension.
List<Extension> extension;

//  May be used to represent additional information that is not part of
// the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the
// understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding
// of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements
// provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe
// and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the
// definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to
// define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met
// as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
// resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier
// extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or
// DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of
// modifierExtension itself).
List<Extension> modifierExtension;

//  Business identifiers assigned to this flag by the performer or other
// systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates
// from server to server.
List<Identifier> identifier;

//  Supports basic workflow.
String status; // <code> enum: active/inactive/entered-in-error;

//  Extensions for status
Element element_status;

//  Allows a flag to be divided into different categories like clinical,
// administrative etc. Intended to be used as a means of filtering which
// flags are displayed to particular user or in a given context.
List<CodeableConcept> category;

//  The coded value or textual component of the flag to display to the
// user.
CodeableConcept code;

//  The patient, location, group, organization, or practitioner etc. this
// is about record this flag is associated with.
Reference subject;

//  The period of time from the activation of the flag to inactivation of
// the flag. If the flag is active, the end of the period should be
// unspecified.
Period period;

//  This alert is only relevant during the encounter.
Reference encounter;

//  The person, organization or device that created the flag.
